    """Returns an array of tags from a specific folder. The function supports filtering and
    recursion. Leave filters blank to return all tags.

    If called in the gateway scope, a Tag Provider must be specified.

    Args:
        parentPath (str): The parent folder path. Leave blank for the root folder. Note: you can
            specify the tag provider name in square brackets at the beginning of the parentPath
            string. Example: "[myTagProvider]MyTagsFolder". If the tag provider name is left off
            then the project default provider will be used.
        tagPath (Optional[str]): Filters on a tag path. Use * as a wildcard for any number of
            characters and a ? for a single character.
        tagType (Optional[str]): Filters on a tag type. Possible values are OPC, MEMORY, DB, QUERY,
            Folder, DERIVED and UDT_INST.
        dataType (Optional[str]): The data type of the tag. Not used for UDT instances or folders.
            Possible values are Int1, Int2, Int4, Int8, Float4, Float8, Boolean, String, and
            DateTime.
        udtParentType (Optional[str]): The name of the parent UDT.
        recursive (Optional[bool]): Recursively search for tags inside of folders. Note: It is
            highly recommended that recursive is set to false, as server timeouts are more likely to
            occur.
        sort (Optional[str]): Sets the sort order, possible values are ASC and DESC. Sorting is done
            on the full path of the tag.

    Returns:
        list[BrowseTag]: An array of BrowseTag. BrowseTag has the following variables: name, path,
            fullPath, type, dataType, and the following functions: isFolder(), isUDT(), isOPC(),
            isMemory(), isExpression(), isQuery().

    property, then the Value property is assumed.

    You can also read the value of tag attributes by appending the attribute to the tagPath
    parameter. See the Tag Attributes page for a list of available attributes.

    Args:
        tagPath (str): Reads from the given tag path. If no property is specified in the path, the
            Value property is assumed.

    sequence. Reading in bulk like this is more efficient than calling read() many times.

    Args:
        tagPaths (list[str]): A sequence of tag paths to read from.

        list[QualifiedValue]: A sequence of qualified values corresponding to each tag path

        value (object): The value to write.
        supressErrors (Optional[bool]): A flag indicating whether or not to suppress errors.

    Args:
        tagPaths (list[str]): The paths of the tags to write to.

    Returns:
